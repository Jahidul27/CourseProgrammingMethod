Assignment 3

Problem 1:
Run program to manipulate and also a secondary version of code is included at the
bottom which implements the heap sort more properly.

Problem 2:
First cpp cover a and b but had to make a similar second cpp in order to get parts c
and d working properly. Use the main equations at the end of the cpp files to 
test the respective parts. Thank you.
